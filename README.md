Unity project for UCSC CMPM 121, Homework 1. Creating a simple game scene.

LONE-STRAND ISLE
by Dominic Berardi

 - What is your scene?

This scene is of a lonely island in the sea, where an unfortunate castaway has found himself deserted after his boat broke. 

 - What kinds of objects did you include?

I have included objects that tell the story of the scene. The castaway man has made shelter and fire with the few palm trees there, 
and finds food in the fish and coconuts of the island. He must beware, though, as a shark circles the island. 
At least there is a treasure chest buried there! ...If he ever makes it off the island. Maybe the smiley face made of rocks on the island 
will catch a plane's attention? Various other things you would find on a beach, such as shells and a crab are scattered about as well.

 - Did anything inspire you?

I was inspired to make this partially due to the movie "Cast Away", though I have never even seen the film.
I thought that a beach scene would be easier to construct than a detailed room, while also allowing me to explore more of Unity's features,
such as the terrain painter, skyboxes, and a rotating camera.

 - What is the main character in this scene?
 
 The main character in this scene is the castaway man, taking shade under the palm trees.
